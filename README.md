# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Description
This is a simple **Tic-Tac-Toe game** built in Python.  
Two players, X and O, take turns to mark the spaces on a 3x3 grid. The game continues until all positions are filled. This beginner-level project demonstrates:

- Using **lists** to represent the game board
- **Loops** to handle turns
- **User input** to choose positions
- **Conditional statements** to check for valid moves
- **Switching players** after each turn

## How to Play
1. Run the Python program.
2. Players take turns to input a number from **1 to 9** corresponding to the position on the board.
3. The board updates after each move.
4. The game ends after all 9 moves.
